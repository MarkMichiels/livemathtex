# Phase 4 Plan 01 Summary: Output Unit Conversion Tests/Docs

## Objective

Verify and document the existing `<!-- [unit] -->` unit conversion functionality.

## What Was Done

### Merged with Plan 04-02

The work for 04-01 (unit conversion tests) was merged with 04-02 (inline unit syntax) since:
1. Both involve unit conversion testing
2. Implementing inline syntax required testing both approaches
3. More efficient to document both syntaxes together

See 04-02-SUMMARY.md for full details.

### Key Outcomes

- ISS-007 verified working (unit conversion via HTML comments)
- Documentation updated to cover both syntaxes
- ISS-007 closed in ISSUES.md

## Verification

All verification from plan 04-02 applies.

## Duration

Combined with 04-02: ~10 minutes total.
