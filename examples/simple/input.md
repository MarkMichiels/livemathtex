# Simple Calculation Example

This example demonstrates the basic livemathtex operators.

## Definitions (:=)

Define some variables:

$a := 10$
$b := 5$

## Evaluation (==)

Calculate sum and product:

$total := a + b ==$

$product := a \cdot b ==$

## Combined Definition + Evaluation

$ratio := \frac{a}{b} ==$

## Re-evaluate existing variable

$total ==$

## Summary

With simple definitions and evaluations, we can build up calculations step by step.
