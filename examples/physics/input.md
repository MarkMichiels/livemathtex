# Newton's Second Law: F = m × a

This example demonstrates force calculation with SI units.

## Given Values

Mass of the object (10 kg):
$mass := 10 \cdot kg$

Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²):
$accel := 9.81 \cdot \frac{m}{s^2}$

## Calculate Force

Using Newton's second law \( F = m \cdot a \):

$F := mass \cdot accel ==$

The result should be approximately 98.1 N (Newtons).

## Verify with Different Mass

$mass_2 := 25 \cdot kg$
$F_2 := mass_2 \cdot accel ==$

## Calculate Ratio (dimensionless)

$ratio := \frac{F_2}{F} ==$

The heavier object experiences 2.5× more force.
